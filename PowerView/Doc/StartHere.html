<h1>PowerView</h1>

<p>Thank you for taking an interest into PowerView.</p>

<p></p>

<p>PowerView provides a home overview for electricity consumption/production, water 
consumption and heat consumption. PowerView organizes and visualizes 
reading data per. meter or inverter using a unique label name representing each. 
Features are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visualize consumption and production data in graphs over day, month and year timespan</li>
  <li>Calculate consumption/production between two dates</li>
  <li>Relay control based on per. phase electricity production</li>
  <li>Store data for record keeping</li>
  <li>Expose a pvoutput.org facade for intercepting inverter production data</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>The below figure presents a deployment of PowerView</p>

<p><img alt="Overview" src="media/Overview.jpg" width="900" /></p>

<p>PowerView accepts meter and inverter readings from PowerLog and a
pvoutput.org facade. The pvoutput.org facade intercepts the inverter data
and forwards the inverter data to official pvoutput.org. The meter and 
inverter readings are stored in a database. Using a browser it is 
possible to visualize the database reading content.</p>

<p>Meter consumption readings is sensitive information. Therefore
PowerView is intended to operate in the home area network. It is
not advisable puting the sensitive information into the cloud unless
appropriately secured.</p>

<h3>PowerView Box</h3>

<p>Pretty much any box will do as long as it is capable of running .NET
Framework (version 4.5.2 or greater) and has the necessary connectivity interfaces. Some
examples: Raspberry Pi, Linux desktop/laptop, Windows desktop/laptop.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Test</h2>

<p>PowerView has been tested with the following configuration.</p>

<p>PowerView Box: Raspberry Pi (Raspbian Buster) with an ethernet cable for network access.</p>
