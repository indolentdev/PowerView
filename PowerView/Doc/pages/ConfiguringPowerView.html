<h1>Configuring PowerView</h1>

<p>If PowerView is to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi consider configuring PowerView
before installation. It might be easier.</p>

<p>PowerView is configured through the file: appsettings.json.
Therefore to configure PowerView open the appsettings.json file in a text
editor.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Default Configuration</h2>

<p>The PowerView default configuration assumes execution on a Raspberry Pi Linux
environment. The default configuration assumes deploymet in Denmark.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Configuring Services</h2>

<p>The PowerView services are configured in the following section of the configuration file:</p>
<pre>  "Service": {
    "BaseUrl": "http://*:47362"
  },</pre>

<p>The BaseUrl property defines the URL at which PowerView provides its web (HTTP) services.
The asterisk (*) character means the local IP address on the home area network and localohost (127.0.0.1). 
Visualizing readings in a browser can be initiated by navigating to this base URL.</p> 

<h2>Configuring Database</h2>

<p>Aspects of the PowerView reading database is configured in the following section of the configuration file:</p>
<pre>  "Database": {
    "Name": "/var/lib/PowerView/PowerView.sqlite3",
    "Backup": {
      "MinimumInterval": "14.00:00:00",
      "MaximumCount": 5
    }
  },</pre>

<p>The Name property defines the path and file name for the PowerView database. The 
Backup property defines database backup parameters. Whenever PowerView starts a database
backup is performed depending the values of these parameters. Database backups are placed
in a DbBackup sub-directory inside the directory declared in the Name element.</p>

<p>The MinimumInterval property defines the minimum time span that must be between databasea
backups. The string 14.00:00:00 means 14 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes and 0 seconds. The MaximumCount
property is the maximum number of database backups kept by PowerView. Database backups exceeding 
this number will be deleted, oldest backup is deleted first.</p>
