<h1>Installing PowerView</h1>

<p>Describes installing and running PowerView.</p>

<h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>

<h3>Install</h3>

<p>Follow this procedure to install PowerView on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian
Stretch. It is assumed that the PowerView.exe.config file in the
unzipped folder already has the correct configuration settings.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the unzipped folder containing PowerView to the Raspberry pi, e.g.
    using a USB flash dongle or via LAN. For this procedure /home/pi/PowerView is
    used for the temporary folder from where PowerView is installed.</li>
  <li>Start a terminal and change directory into /home/pi/PowerView</li>
  <li>Execute the command: <code>chmod +x InstallPowerView.sh && sudo ./InstallPowerView.sh</code></li>
  <li>Assuming all went well remove the /home/pi/PowerView folder</li>
  <li>Reboot the box to launch PowerView as part of startup.</li>
</ol>

<p>After install PowerView is placed in: /opt/PowerView/. PowerView process log file
is: /var/log/PowerView.log.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Monitor log file</h3>

<p>To view the PowerView log file one option is to use tail. In a terminal write:
<code>tail -n 100 -f /var/log/PowerView.log</code> to follow the log file (do
Ctrl+X Ctrl+C to exit the tail).</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Stopping</h3>

<p>PowerView can be stopped using the provided stop script: StopPowerView.sh. Change
directory into /opt/PowerView and run: <code>sudo ./StopPowerView.sh</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<p>Depending on Linux distribution the Raspberry Pi procedure may work (should
work on ubuntu). If not, then manually copy the PowerView folder to where you want
it. The file named "PowerView" should be compatible with init.d requirements,
though you may need to tailor some paths/files. If all else fails run PowerView
using the command: <code>sudo mono PowerView.exe</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>The PowerView distribution package does not come with an installer for Windows,
you are on your own. A rough guide; copy the PowerView folder to where you want
it. To run PowerView simply run: <code>PowerView.exe</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Visualizing readings</h1>

<p>When PowerView is running and using a browser from a device connected to the
home area network navigate to the following URL:  
<code>http://{IP address of PowerView Box}:47362</code> which takes you to the
default visualization page.</p>
